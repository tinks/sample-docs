The company recommends the following security measures for the Android TV boxes installed in your environment:

* Updates to the operating system should be installed on the Android TV boxes when they become available from the manufacturer.
* Updates to the Live TV app should be installed on the Android TV boxes when they become available from the company.
* The Android TV boxes should be installed in an isolated network, because the devices themselves do not support authentication, and do not have a firewall embedded.
* The Android TV boxes should only connect to the isolated network through an Ethernet cable and the wireless connection capabilities should be disabled.
* Incoming access to the Android TV boxes should be provided through a jump host, a gateway, or similar technologies.
* Outgoing access from the Android TV boxes to the company's cloud services must be allowed.
